- **[Item Expansion](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/tree/item_expansion):** Adds items from newer Generations and also updates item effects for field use.
- **[Following Pokémon](https://github.com/W1serV1ser/pokeemerald/tree/FollowingPokemon_Gen1-3):** Adds the Player's lead party Pokémon as a follower in the overworld.
- **[DexNav](https://github.com/ghoulslash/pokeemerald/tree/dexnav):** Includes a simplified DexNav including search and detector modes.
